# korean-english-trainer

Korean-English Trainer is going to be very first own project using JavaScript, which I started learning few weeks ago, so in February 2019. It will be simple just to test how well I understand concepts I learnt. The idea came because my wife started learning Korean, and she wanted a method to test her skills in words translation. 

STEPS I NEED TO ACCOMPLISH PROJECT: 

I.) HTML Structure 

INPUT Section:
	- two input fields, one for Korean, and one for English
	- button to submit both words

OUTPUT Section: 
	- two fields, one for showing Korean, one for English words
	- button to show new word
	- button to stwitch which language is user guessing at the moment
 
II,) CSS Structure

	- flags of both Countries
	- nice Korea-related background image

III.) JavaScript Structure

	Stage 1.) INPUT - take user's input (both Korean and English word) and save it somewhere

	Stage 2.) RANDOMIZE - when user want's to train we must randomize words

	Stage 3.) OUTPUT - show user one words from a pair
